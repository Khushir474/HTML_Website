<font size=5 color=48b0ec><b>CONCEPTION AND CREATION</b></font><p><font size = 4><img src="\Computer\Pictures\Animated GIFs\Animation_title_card.gif" style=float:right;width:380;height:238 alt="Supernatural">Before making <u><i>Supernatural</i></u> one of the most popular television series, creator Eric Kripke had 
been struggling with the series for nearly 10 years. The initial idea for the series was that a tabloid reporter who drove around the country in van "fighting demons in search of the 
truth". Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories 
exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories."</p>
<P>As he had previously written for The WB series Tarzan, Kripke was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network and used the opportunity for <u><i>Supernatural.</i></u>
As the odds weren't in Kripke's favor, he lost the support of the network because of his tabloid reporter concept. Kripke later changed the characters to two brothers from 
<u><i>Lawrence Kansas</i></u>, Sal and Dean.</p>
<p>However, he felt that "Sal" as a main character was inappropriate so he changed it to "Sam" which became a sexy, lovable character in time by all the fangirls, for instance me.
Another problem arised regarding their surnames. Kripke wanted for the brother's last names to be Harrison in honor of the ever-popluar actor Harrison Ford. However, there was a Sam 
Harrison living in Kansas so he had to change it for legal reasons. Somehow, through his interest for <u><i>Winchester Mystery House</u></i>, he ended up with the name "Winchester". 
Again, this also presented a problem<br> as there was a Jack Winchester alive in Kansas (Jack was Sam and Dean's dad) so he changed the character's name to "John".
<p>Kripke had previously pitched the series to Fox executive Peter Johnson, and when Johnson moved to Wonderland Sound and Vision as president of TV, he contacted Kripke. Johnson soon 
signed on as co-executive producer, as did Wonderland owner McG as executive producer, with the production company set to make the pilot episode. Before it could be filmed, however, 
script issues needed to be dealt with. Originally, the brothers were not raised by their father, but rather by their aunt and uncle. Thus, when Dean comes to Sam for assistance in the 
pilot episode, he has to convince him that the supernatural exists. However, Kripke realized that this made the backstory too complicated and reworked it with Peter Johnson so that 
their father raised them to be hunters. The script went through many additional revisions. One of the original ideas was for Sam's girlfriend Jessica to be revealed as a demon, which 
prompts him to join Dean on the road; however, Kripke felt it was more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death, so he had her killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, 
making them the "right bookends". Other revised concepts include Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer that murders their father and their father dying in Jessica's place. Filming 
for the pilot episode was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on. When the series was eventually picked up, the studio brought
in Robert Singer as executive producer, as it wanted Kripke to work with someone with production experience. Due to his previous work on The X-Files, co-executive producer John Shiban 
was also hired to help design the series mythology. Kripke had the series planned out for three seasons but later expanded it to five and hoped to end it there on a high note.</p><br><br>

<font size=5 color=48b0ec><b>ABOUT THAT CAR</b></font><br>
<img src="\Computer\Pictures\Others\Impala.png" style=float:right;width:380;height:253><font size = 4><p>Growing up, Kripke connected to television shows that had signature cars, such as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. This prompted him to include one in Supernatural. 
He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since "you can put a body in the trunk" and because "you want a car 
that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors. Kripke has commented, "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because
of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show."</font></p><br><br>
<font size=5 color=48b0ec><b>MUSIC</b></font><br>
<p><font size=4>Supernatural is known for it's musics in it. Supernatural features a synthesized orchestral score, although traditional acoustic instruments such as guitars and cellos are used at times.
Special instruments have also been used in specific episodes, such as "bluesy gospel music" played on a broken-down piano in the faith-healing episode "Faith". Unlike other television 
shows, the series features two composers: <u><i>Christopher Lennertz</i></u><br>and <i><u>Jay Gruska.</u></i></p>
<p>While original scores are used throughout episodes, another important aspect of the series' music is the use of classic rock, over which creator Eric Kripke threatened to quit when the
network would not allow its inclusion. Most of the songs are from Kripke's private collection, although one of his favorite bands—Led Zeppelin—is too expensive to use. Some episode titles 
are references to Led Zeppelin songs. The series has featured such bands as Blue Öyster Cult, Bad Company, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rush, Boston, Triumph and AC/DC on more than one occasion.
Multiple songs are usually used throughout each episode, and accompany "The Road So Far" sequences before select episodes that highlight a montage of past events. Although Kripke prefers
to keep a fine line between the score and songs used, sometimes Lennertz and Gruska are required to write short sections of rock-like music to fill 15-to-20-second gaps, as it would be too
costly to acquire song rights. Always on the last episode of every season except the first season, the song "Carry On Wayward Son" by Kansas is played at the beginning.</font></p><br><br>
