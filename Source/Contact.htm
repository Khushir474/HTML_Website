<center>Hey Hunters, lemme me tell you a bit about myself.<br>
It's Khushi here btw. I'm 15. Love to draw. Care about the environment a lot but not too much. Like anybody else who checkes this page out with <i>interest</i>, I myself am a huge Hunter from 4 years and counting. I'm a Dean-O-Holic though. 
Sorry Sam-O-Holics! It's not that i don't love Sam, I just love Dean more. Sam lovers or not, I'm sure y'all would agree when I say we loved demon, soulless Sam. Hunters all over the world have had some great 11 years. Hopefully Season 11 is not the last season
nor should Season 29 be! If you have anything on your mind, be it comments, suggestions or critisism, let it all out at
